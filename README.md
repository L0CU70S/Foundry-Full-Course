# 🛠️ Foundry Full Course - Learning & Security Research
This repository contains my progress through the Cyfrin Updraft Foundry Full Course. 
Beyond following the lessons, I am documenting each section from a **Smart Contract Auditor's perspective**.

## 🛡️ Security Mindset
In each module, I focus on:
- Potential vulnerability vectors.
- Gas optimization patterns.
- Best practices in Solidity security.
